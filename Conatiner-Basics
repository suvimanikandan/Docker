What is Containerization(Container)?
-->Containerization is a light weight virtualization technology alternative to hypervisor virtualization.
Any Application can be bundled in a container can run without any woriess about dependencies ,libraries and binaries.
-->Because container creates the isolated environment with all the required dependencies,libraries and binaries to run your application without any issue.
-->hence you can build the packages,ship the application to any environment and run  it.

so containers are designed to run on physical servers,virtual machines and any cloud instances.



Difference between containerization and virtualization
-->Virtualization technology that allows us to have a multiple operating system to share a single hardware processor

-->Containerization is an application-specific  virtualization ,because it provides an application with dedicated environment in the form of 
containers to run on, which can be deployed and run anywhere without a dedicated virtual machine with operating system for each application.


Also container was designed to solve modern problems and application management issues.so it's not a replacement for virtualization but its complementary to it.


Advantages of containers:
->containers are isolated doesn't require operating system and its shares a host kernel.
so,containers run on the same server and use the same resources,they don not interact with each other because its isolated .
if one application crashes,other containers with the same application will keep running without any issues.

->Its a portable and light weight operating system and it contains only the required binaries ,dependencies and libraries to run the application
so it compatiblity dependencies kind of issues.

->Faster and resources efficiency- its very fast to boot ,because containers are light weighted and start in less than second since they do not  a require an operating system boot

->Resource efficency since containers do not a require a seperate operating system,they use less resource

->improve scalablity- and lower costs.By allowing more containers in the environment without the need for more servers,containerization increases 
scalablity anywhere form1-0 to 100 times of that of traditional environments.
